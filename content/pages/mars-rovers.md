# Mars Rovers: Robotic Explorers of the Red Planet

From the first successful rover in 1997 to today's sophisticated geological laboratories on wheels, Mars rovers have revolutionized our understanding of the Red Planet. Each mission has pushed the boundaries of technology while searching for signs of past or present life on Mars.
